A great example of this is the hackathon that I'm currently participating in. It has been a very high pressure environment and it has been very stressful and I am very tired and I really want to go home.We used Too Much AI. So we had to figure out what the AI was doing, so we could replicate it and that was stressful.AI is the problem. You are the problem.I didn't know how to use a microwave and I really wanted to heat up my food. So I really had to quickly learn how to use microwave so that I could heat up my food and the food was popcorn and it was really good.
