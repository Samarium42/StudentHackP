6) Describe the Problem you identified that could exist in 2080 : In the year 2080, the integration of autonomous robots and humanoids into daily life and workspaces is expected to have progressed significantly. While these technological advancements offer efficiency and cost-effectiveness, they also pose a significant risk of increasing human isolation. Despite the convenience brought by automation, the intrinsic human need for interaction and connection persists. This growing disconnection could potentially exacerbate feelings of loneliness and detachment in society.

SmartHire, initially developed to assist individuals in preparing for job interviews through real-time feedback on body language and tone of speech, highlights an underlying issue. As robots become more integrated into the hiring process, the subtle nuances of human communication, which are crucial for understanding and empathy, are at risk of being overlooked. Automation can handle tasks and even mimic certain human interactions, but it cannot fully replicate the deep-seated human qualities of empathy and emotional intelligence.

7) Describe your proposed solution to that problem - SmartHire provides a solution to the problem of human disconnection in an automated future by leveraging technology to enhance human interaction rather than replace it. By using advanced sentiment analysis, SmartHire offers real-time feedback to users on their body language and tone of speech, which are critical components of effective communication. This technology serves as a training tool that helps individuals improve their interpersonal skills, making them more prepared and confident for interviews.

However, the application of SmartHire extends beyond individual preparation. In a future dominated by automation, SmartHire could be instrumental for companies aiming to maintain a balance between technological efficiency and the human touch. By integrating SmartHire's capabilities into their hiring processes, companies can ensure that they are not only assessing the technical skills of their candidates but also their ability to engage, empathize, and interact effectively with others

8) Explain the codebase briefly - We built our project using React, Express, TypeScript, and JavaScript to create a clean, accessible user interface. The NEUPHONIC API handled text-to-speech conversion for realistic interview simulations, while the Google Gemini API processed CVs, job descriptions, and live transcriptions to generate relevant follow-up questions. We also implemented sentiment analysis and word frequency tracking on user speech to extract deeper context. One technical challenge involved managing three concurrent servers, which occasionally led to slowdowns; we mitigated this using libraries like NumPy and strategic timing controls such as time.sleep() to preserve natural conversation flow.
